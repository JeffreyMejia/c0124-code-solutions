## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
  to repeat and execute the same code multiple times.
- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
  to examine if the expression is true. If it is true then it executes the code block until it is not longer true.
- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
  each "loop" through the code is an iteration.
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
  before each pass through the loop
- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  It is evaluated only once before the loop begins
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  It is evaluated before each loop iteration.
- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  It is evaluated at the end of each loop.
- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  `Break` exits the loop.
- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  It increments the operand by 1 and returns the value before or after the increment depending on it's placement.
- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
  with a `for...in` loop.
