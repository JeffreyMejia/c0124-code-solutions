How to write `Code Examples` in markdown

for JS:

```javascript
const data = 'Howdy';
```

for HTML:

```html
<div>
  <p>This is text content</p>
</div>
```

for CSS:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
}
```

1. Create layout for the input in the component return.
2. Import useState to be used for the input to keep track of the number of characters inputted
3. create function to be used as an event handler that calls the state setter to change the value of the useState.
4. create event listener on the input element that used the event handler function.
