## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  a special kind of object that can be used to hold code that can be reused over and over again to do whatever you tell it to.
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  There is a function keyword that indicates the creation of a new function followed by an optional name. The parameters are in the parentheses that follows each separated by a comma. The code block will be within the `{}` along with the return statement which is also optional.
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  A function being called starts with the name of the function followed by the parentheses. For example `addTwoNumbers()`. Within the parentheses the arguments are passed.
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  In the function definition there are more parts because that is when it is being created. Once it is defined there is no need to defined it again. When a function is defined the parameters are set but when it is called then whatever is in the parentheses is passed as an argument.
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  a parameter is the what is defined when the function is being defined. Arguments are passed through the function when it is called. Parameters are placeholders for unknown values which eventually the arguments will pass through.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  They can be placeholders for values that are not yet known.
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  Causes the function to produce a value and prevents any more code in the functions code block from being run.
